# Standard Home Services App - Prototype Tool Evaluation

## Research Criteria
For the Standard Home Services App prototype, we need tools that can:
1. Create high-fidelity mockups matching the black/white/green color scheme
2. Support interactive elements (buttons, forms, navigation)
3. Allow for easy implementation of the user flow shown in mockups
4. Create a prototype that can be tested on mobile devices
5. Be used without incurring development costs (free options)

## Tool Options Evaluated

### 1. HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Web-Based Approach)
- **Pros:**
  - Completely free
  - Full customization of design elements to match mockups exactly
  - Can be deployed to a permanent URL
  - Can be added to home screen on iOS/Android
  - Supports all required interactions
- **Cons:**
  - Requires coding knowledge
  - More time-intensive to implement
  - May require additional effort for mobile responsiveness

### 2. Figma (Free Plan)
- **Pros:**
  - Industry-standard prototyping tool
  - Free plan available
  - Excellent for creating high-fidelity mockups
  - Strong prototyping capabilities with transitions
  - Shareable prototype links
- **Cons:**
  - Limited features in free plan
  - Not as interactive as coded solutions
  - Cannot implement actual form validation or calculations

### 3. Adobe XD (Free Starter Plan)
- **Pros:**
  - Purpose-built for UI/UX design
  - Good prototyping capabilities
  - Supports animations and transitions
  - Shareable prototype links
- **Cons:**
  - Limited cloud storage in free plan
  - Not as widely used as Figma
  - Cannot implement actual calculations for service pricing

### 4. Marvel App (Free Plan)
- **Pros:**
  - Simple, user-friendly interface
  - Good for quick prototyping
  - Supports basic interactions
  - Shareable prototype links
- **Cons:**
  - Limited to 1 project in free plan
  - Less powerful than other options
  - Limited customization options

## Recommendation

For the Standard Home Services App prototype, I recommend using the **HTML/CSS/JavaScript web-based approach** for the following reasons:

1. **Exact visual matching**: We can precisely recreate the black, white, and green color scheme and layout shown in the mockups
2. **Full interactivity**: We can implement all required interactions including service selection with price calculations
3. **Mobile-friendly**: Can be designed to work well on mobile devices and added to home screen
4. **Completely free**: No cost limitations or restrictions
5. **Permanent deployment**: Can be hosted on a permanent URL for easy sharing
6. **Previous success**: We successfully used this approach for the 3D Home Rendering App prototype

This approach will allow us to create a high-fidelity, interactive prototype that closely matches the mockups while meeting the requirement of being free to develop. The prototype will be accessible via web browser on any device and can be added to the home screen on iOS/Android for a more native app-like experience.
